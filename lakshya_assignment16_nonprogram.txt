1. Create a list called years_list, starting with the year of your birth, and each year thereafter until
the year of your fifth birthday. For example, if you were born in 1980. the list would be years_list =
[1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985].
Answer->years_list = [1996,1997,1998,1999,2000,2001]

2. In which year in years_list was your third birthday? Remember, you were 0 years of age for your
first year.

output- 2001

4. Make a list called things with these three strings as elements: "mozzarella", "cinderella",
"salmonella".
Answer->things = ['mozzarella','cinderella','salmonella']
things
output- ['mozzarella', 'cinderella', 'salmonella']

5. Capitalize the element in things that refers to a person and then print the list. Did it change the
element in the list?
Answer->This capitalizes the word, but doesnâ€™t change it in the list:
things_cap = things.copy()
things_cap[1].capitalize()

things_cap
output- ['mozzarella', 'cinderella', 'salmonella']

6. Make a surprise list with the elements "Groucho," "Chico," and "Harpo."
Answer->surprise = ['Groucho', 'Chico', 'Harpo']
surprise
output- ['Groucho', 'Chico', 'Harpo']

7. Lowercase the last element of the surprise list, reverse it, and then capitalize it.
Answer->surprise[-1] = surprise[-1].lower()
surprise[-1] = surprise[-1][::-1]
surprise[-1].capitalize()
output- 'Oprah'

8. Make an English-to-French dictionary called e2f and print it. Here are your starter words: dog is

e2f
output- {'dog': 'chien', 'cat': 'chat', 'walrus': 'morse'}

9. Write the French word for walrus in your three-word dictionary e2f.

10. Make a French-to-English dictionary called f2e from e2f. Use the items method.

for english, french in e2f.items():
 f2e[french] = english
f2e

13. Make a multilevel dictionary called life. Use these strings for the topmost keys: 'animals', 'plants',

Answer->life = {'animals': {'cats': ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'],'octopi': {},'emus': {}},'plants': {},'other': {}}
life
output- {'animals': {'cats': ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'], 'octopi': {}, 'emus': {}},'plants': {},'other': {}}

14. Print the top-level keys of life.
Answer->print(life.keys())
output- dict_keys(['animals', 'plants', 'other'])

15. Print the keys for life['animals'].
Answer->print(life['animals'].keys())
output- dict_keys(['cats', 'octopi', 'emus'])

16. Print the values for life['animals']['cats']
Answer->print(life['animals']['cats'])
output- ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy']
